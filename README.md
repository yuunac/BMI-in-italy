# BMI-in-italy

This project is based on ISTAT dataset called "Indice_Massa_Sesso.csv", under CCBY 3.0 License. The purpose of the project is to underline which of the Italian region has the highest % of people with a BMI>25, which could be very dangerous for health.
I did the research using Python and two of the its most important libraries for data analysis, Pandas and NumPy and I did the following actions in order to reach my purpose:
- Data cleaning
- Data sorting
- Data visualization with Flourish and Data Wrapper

I also put the result of the research on a .pdf file, written in Italian
